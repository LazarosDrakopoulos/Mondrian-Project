# Mondrian-Project

This project is an homage to the iconic abstract artist Piet Mondrian, translating his distinctive geometric compositions into a static web page. Using CSS Grid layout, the page accurately replicates Mondrian's grid-based approach, with colored rectangles arranged in a visually striking pattern reminiscent of his artwork.
